# Machine Learning Practice

This repository serves as a refresher for practicing widely used Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. It includes Python implementations for various ML models, ranging from basic to advanced, using diverse datasets.

## Introduction
This repository is designed to reinforce concepts and skills in Machine Learning by working on hands-on examples with Python. It includes code for:
- Basic Python concepts.
- Data preprocessing.
- Supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms.
- Evaluating models and tuning hyperparameters.

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have:
- Python 3.7+
- Libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ML Models Covered
1. **Linear Regression**
   - Predicting house prices using the Boston Housing dataset.

2. **Logistic Regression**
   - Classifying diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.

3. **Decision Trees**
   - Predicting survival on the Titanic dataset.

4. **Random Forest**
   - Feature importance and classification on a custom dataset.

5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - Classification of the Iris dataset.

6. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
   - Classification using a two-class synthetic dataset.

7. **K-Means Clustering**
   - Customer segmentation on a retail dataset.

8. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
   - Dimensionality reduction on a wine quality dataset.

9. **Neural Networks (Basic)**
   - Binary classification using a synthetic dataset.

10. **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**
    - Predicting loan default on a financial dataset.

## Datasets Used
- **Synthetic Datasets**: Generated using `sklearn.datasets` for SVM and Neural Networks.
